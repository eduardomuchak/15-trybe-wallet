### About:

TrybeWallet is a project in which an application was developed to help users manage their expenses in different currencies.

This was the first project where I started to pay more attention to how accessible my application is, so I followed up with a color palette that could be within the WCAG Standard - AA and AAA.

In addition, the project consisted of using ReactJS together with Redux to manage application states and the conversation between components and also using Bootstrap to make it responsive.
